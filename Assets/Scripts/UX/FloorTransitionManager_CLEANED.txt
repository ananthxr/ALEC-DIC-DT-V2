FLOOR TRANSITION MANAGER - CLEANED VERSION
===========================================

FILE: Y:\ALEC DIC DT V2\Assets\Scripts\UX\FloorTransitionManager.cs

REMOVED DEPENDENCIES:
---------------------
✅ SNSRDropdownAnimator (not in V2 project)
✅ CameraController (using direct DOTween camera control instead)
✅ LightingController (not needed for core functionality)
✅ RoomTransitionManager (not needed for core functionality)

WHAT REMAINS (CORE FUNCTIONALITY):
-----------------------------------
✅ Floor animation system (burger-style lift)
✅ NPC building hide/show animations
✅ Camera movement using DOTween
✅ Floor state management (None, Ground, First, Roof)
✅ Camera view states (Default, FloorNormal, FloorTopView)

HOW TO USE:
-----------

1. ADD TO SCENE:
   - Create empty GameObject: "FloorTransitionManager"
   - Add FloorTransitionManager.cs component

2. ASSIGN IN INSPECTOR:

   [Floor Configuration]
   - Add floor entries (Ground, Mezzanine, First, Roof)
     * Floor Name: "Ground Floor"
     * Floor Object: The 3D model GameObject
     * Origin Position: Empty transform at normal position
     * Out Position: Empty transform far away
     * Camera Position: Side view camera transform
     * Top View Position: Top-down camera transform

   [NPC Buildings]
   - Add exterior objects to hide
     * Building Name: "Building A"
     * Building Object: The 3D model
     * Target Hide Position: Vector3 (e.g., x=1000, y=0, z=0)

   [Camera Configuration]
   - Main Camera: Your scene's main camera
   - Default Camera Position: Default view transform

3. INTEGRATE WITH FLOORBUTTONSTACKING:

Add to FloorButtonStacking.cs:

```csharp
[Header("Floor Transition")]
[SerializeField] private FloorTransitionManager floorTransitionManager;

private void OnFloorButtonClicked(int floorIndex)
{
    // Existing code...

    // Trigger floor transition
    if (floorTransitionManager != null)
    {
        floorTransitionManager.SelectFloor(floorIndex);
    }
}
```

ANIMATION FLOW:
---------------

When SelectFloor(index) is called:

STEP 1: Hide NPC Buildings
→ All exterior buildings slide to hide positions

STEP 2: Animate Floors (Burger Style)
→ Floors ABOVE selected: Lift UP → Forward → Exit
→ Floors BELOW selected: Lift DOWN → Forward → Exit
→ Selected floor: Stays at origin

STEP 3: Move Camera
→ Waits cameraWaitTime (0.8s)
→ Smoothly moves to top-view position

CUSTOMIZABLE SETTINGS:
----------------------

Animation Speed Multiplier: 1.0x (faster = higher, slower = lower)

Durations:
- Floor Move Duration: 0.75s
- Camera Duration: 1.5s
- Camera Wait Time: 0.8s

3-Step Animation:
- Lift Duration: 0.4s
- Forward Duration: 0.3s
- Exit Duration: 0.5s

Burger Lift:
- Base Lift Height: 4 units
- Additional Lift Per Floor: 1.5 units
- Forward Offset: 50 units
- Exit Distance: 500 units

Easing:
- Floor Ease: InOutQuart
- Camera Ease: InOutCubic

PUBLIC METHODS:
---------------

SelectFloor(int floorIndex, bool skipCameraMovement = false)
→ Transition to specific floor

ResetToNoneState()
→ Return all floors to origin

ToggleTopView()
→ Switch between top-view and normal view

PUBLIC PROPERTIES:
------------------

IsTransitioning (bool)
CurrentState (FloorState)
CurrentCameraView (CameraViewState)
CurrentFloorIndex (int)
CanUseTopView (bool)

COMPILE STATUS:
---------------
✅ No missing dependencies
✅ All CameraController references removed
✅ All SNSR references removed
✅ Camera movement uses DOTween directly
✅ Ready to use in V2 project
